This section describes the steps to migrate your team to the latest version of Postman.

Postman v9 provides a consistent, improved API development experience. The Postman desktop app and [Postman on the web](https://community.postman.com/t/whats-new-in-postman-for-the-web/18203) are equally empoweringâ€”which one you use is a matter of preference for your workflows.

You can start using Postman v9 and access the new UI and features once the update is completed.

> Postman v9.4 is the last version of the Postman app that supports both 32-bit and 64-bit Windows. All versions of the Postman app following v9.4 will only work on 64-bit Windows. You can continue to use Postman v9.4 and earlier on 32-bit Windows.

## Upgrading to Postman v8

### Upgrading to v8 as an individual

Non-team users can move from Postman v7 to v8 by updating the app via **Settings** > **Update** > **Download update**.

It is important to verify your work is synced to make sure no data is lost during the update. Click __Verify Sync__.

Once your work is synced, you can update to Postman v8. Click __Update to v8__.

You can start using Postman v8 and access the new UI and features once the update is completed.

### Upgrading to v8 as a team

Team members on v7 can upgrade to v8 by updating the app via **Settings** > **Update** > **Download update**. You do not need an approval from an admin to upgrade from v7 to v8.

> If you are on a team and download Postman v8 while the rest of your team is using a previous version of Postman v7, you will still be able to use v8. Syncing and collaboration will not be affected.
