Postman provides a variety of views and controls to manage your API projects.

[![Postman app](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/app-overview-v9.5.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/app-overview-v9.5.jpg)

The Postman UI includes the following components:

* The left sidebar provides access to your [collections](/docs/getting-started/creating-the-first-collection/), [APIs](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/creating-an-api/), [environments](/docs/sending-requests/managing-environments/#creating-environments), [mock servers](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/mocking-data/setting-up-mock/), [monitors](/docs/running-collections/scheduling-collection-runs/), and request [history](#history).
* The header allows you to create workspaces, access reports, explore the public API network, [search](#universal-search) within Postman, view sync status and notifications, move and invite collaborators to workspaces, capture requests and cookies, and access your settings, account, and [Postman plan](/docs/administration/buying/).
* The center area is where you build and work with requests.
* The status bar along the bottom allows you to show/hide the sidebar, [find and replace](#find-and-replace), and open the [console](/docs/sending-requests/troubleshooting-api-requests/) on the left. On the right, you can launch the __Bootcamp__, collection runner, trash, and two pane view, as well as access help resources.

On the right panel, you can see icons to view the documentation, comments, code, and request info.

<img alt="Right panel icons" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/right-panel-view-v8.jpg" width="300px"/>

To open the __Documentation__ tab, select the request under your collection and select the Documentation icon <img alt="Mini docs icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/mini-docs-icon-v8.jpg" width="25px"/> on the right panel.

<img alt="Documentation icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/overview-documentations-v8.jpg"/>

To open the documentation in another tab, select __View complete collection documentation__.

<img alt="Overview Documentation" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/documentation-pane-v8.jpg" width="400px"/>

To publish a documentation for a collection, see [Publishing your documentation](/docs/publishing-your-api/publishing-your-docs/).

To open the __Comments__ tab, select the request under your collection and the Comments icon <img alt="Mini comments icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/mini-comments-icon-v8.jpg" width="30px"/> on the right panel. You can switch to comment mode to leave comments on a specific part of the request, including parameters, headers, body, and tests.

[![Overview Comments](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/overview-comments-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/overview-comments-v8.jpg)

To learn more about comments, see [Commenting on collections](/docs/collaborating-in-postman/commenting-on-collections/).

To open the __Code snippets__ tab, select the request under your collection, and then select the Code icon <img alt="Code snippet icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-code-snippet.jpg" width="16px" style="vertical-align:middle;margin-bottom:5px"> on the right panel. For more information, see [Generating code snippets](/docs/sending-requests/generate-code-snippets/).

<img alt="Code snippets Pane" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/code-snippet-pane-v8.jpg" width="350px"/>

## Resizing and collapsing panes

You can drag the bottom panel to resize the panes in the Postman UI.

[![Resizing panes](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/panes-resized-v8.gif)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/panes-resized-v8.gif)

You can also declutter your workspace by collapsing panes. Use the button at the bottom-left to hide the sidebar and the button at the bottom-right to toggle between a single and two pane view.

[![general layout](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/split-pane-view-v8.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/split-pane-view-v8.jpg)

## Related Collections

When a request is selected in Postman, you can see a Related Collections (light bulb) icon <img alt="Related Collections icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/collection-rec-lightbulb-icon2.jpg" width="25px"/> on the right panel.

Select the icon to view public collections from the [API Network](https://www.postman.com/explore/) that share the same base URL as your request and include API documentation to help you get started.

<img alt="Related Collections suggestions" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/collection-rec-v8.8.0.jpg"/>

You can select any recommended collection to view its contents and documentation. You can also directly fork a recommended collection to quick-start your development.

## Universal search

You can access universal search by selecting __Search Postman__ at the top of Postman, or by using the keyboard shortcut `Command + K`.

Enter your search string and change the scope of search to narrow down your search results to all of Postman, your personal or team space, or the Public API Network. You can also change the scope of your search to **Workspaces**, **Collections**, **APIs**, or **Teams**.

![Changing scope for universal search](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/change-scope-for-universal-search-v9.5.jpg)

> For signed-in users, the default search scope on workspaces is Team. On [explore](https://www.postman.com/explore), the default is Public API Network. For signed-out users, the results only include public resources and do not contain private data.

If you do not find what you are looking for in the list of results, select __Search all workspaces, collections, APIs and teams__ and you can find all the results in one page.

<img alt="Search all" src ="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/search-all-workspaces-collections-and-teams-v9.5.jpg"/>

The left navigation on the __Search results__ page lists the scope and entity type. You can change these options to further filter your results.

<img alt="Universal search results page" src ="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/universal-search-results-page-v8.jpg"/>

You can sort results using __Sort by__ on the right by selecting _Most relevant_ (default), _Most views_, or _Most recent_.

<img alt="Search results sort" src ="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/search-result-sort-by-v8.jpg"/>

Depending on the entity type, the search results contain different information:

* For workspaces, the search result contains the workspace type, summary, who published it, and when was it published.
* For collections, the search result contains the workspace type, whether the collection is a fork or not, who published it, and when was it published.
* For APIs, the search result contains the name and summary of the API, the API's owner (either an individual user or a team), and the type of workspace.
* For teams, the search result contains the name and summary of the team. Selecting the team name redirects you to the team profile.

## Find and replace

In the Postman app, you can search the current workspace by selecting __Find and Replace__ in the status bar at the bottom left, or by entering __âŒ˜+Shift+F__ or __Ctrl+Shift+F__.

Enter your search string and, optionally, choose which entities to return, entering replacement text if necessary.

![Find and replace](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/find-and-replace-tab-v8.jpg)

Postman searches tabs, collections, and variables. You can select an item directly in the search results to open an entity.

> __Find and Replace__ is not available in Postman for Web.

## History

You can access a history of the requests you've made in the __History__ tab on the left. If you're signed into a Postman account, your history syncs across your devices.

<img alt="History Request" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/history-request-v8.jpg" width="400px"/>

Select a request to open it again. Select __+__ to save the request to a collection. Toggle __Save Responses__ to save request responses so that you can view what was returned by a request when you open it from your history.

The history also includes the collection runs executed. These remain as the summarized version of the run and aren't logged as single requests. The __Save Responses__ option cannot be used with requests from collection runner.

The __View more actions__ menu allows you to save, monitor, document, or mock a request. Use the delete (trash icon) or __Clear all__ options to remove requests from your history. You can select multiple requests by pressing `Command` or `Control` and selecting the requests.

## Tabs

Open a tab to send a request in Postman. Select __+__ in the middle of the screen or press `Command/Control + T`.

![Tabs](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/open-unsaved-tab-options-v8.jpg)

> If you open a request and do not edit or send it, then open another request, the first tab is replaced by the second tab. When the tab is in _Preview_ mode, it displays in italics.

You can have multiple tabs open at the same time, and drag tabs around to arrange them. Select <img alt="Three dots icon" src="https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/icon-three-dots-v9.jpg" width="18px" style="vertical-align:middle;margin-bottom:5px"> to manage your tabs and access recent tabs.

> Duplicating a tab does not mean creating a second request to the same endpoint. When you duplicate a tab, any edits you make affect the original request.

Postman displays a dot on tabs with unsaved changes.

A tab may indicate a conflict if you or a collaborator changes it in another tab or workspace. Postman prompts you to resolve any conflicts that may occur.

> You can toggle whether or not Postman opens requests in new tabs in the __Settings__. You can also configure whether or not Postman prompts you when closing tabs with unsaved changes.

## Next steps

The best way to get to know Postman is by firing up the __Bootcamp__ on the bottom-right and working through the lessons.

![Bootcamp](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/bootcamp-lesson-v8.gif)

To find additional resources to get started with Postman, select **Home** in the upper-left corner.
