You can import your existing OpenAPI 3.0 and 3.1 definitions (OpenAPI Specification) into Postman. Postman supports both YAML and JSON formats. You can choose to upload a file, enter a URL, or directly copy your JSON/YAML. In Postman, select **Import** to bring up the following screen:

[![import sample](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/open-api-import-b.jpg)](https://assets.postman.com/postman-docs/open-api-import-b.jpg)

When importing your OpenAPI specification, Postman follows the endpoint hierarchy defined in the specification to create a collection organized into folders (if your OpenAPI has multiple levels of hierarchy). Postman uses the schemas defined in the OpenAPI to generate request and response bodies.
