## API sync with Bitbucket

Postman 9.0 introduced the ability to connect a git repository to an API. Instead of using an integration, you can directly connect a Bitbucket repo to an API in the API Builder. This provides two-way sync of schemas and associated collections, plus adds powerful new features for syncing branches and release tags between Postman and your repo. For more information on the new repo sync feature, see [Versioning APIs](/docs/designing-and-developing-your-api/versioning-an-api/).

## Backing up collections on Bitbucket

You can back up your Postman Collections to your Bitbucket repository. Once the integration is configured, any new changes to your collection in Postman will also appear in Bitbucket.

### Configuring a Bitbucket integration

From the **[Home](https://go.postman.co/home)** page select **[Integrations](https://go.postman.co/integrations)**.
