CircleCI is a cloud-based continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) platform. Software development teams use CircleCI to run build jobs, automate tests, and orchestrate complex workflows.

To set up CircleCI integration for your API, youâ€™ll need to create an API token in CircleCI and configure your API in Postman. After you set up the integration, you can view the status of builds or kick off a new build, all from within Postman.

## Creating a CircleCI API Token

1. Log into [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/settings/user/tokens) and navigate to **User Settings > Personal API Tokens**.
1. Select **Create New Token**.
1. Enter a **Token Name** and select **Add API Token**.
1. Select **Copy** to copy the new token. (You might want to save the token somewhere safe.)

## Configuring CircleCI integration

1. Open your API by selecting **APIs** in the left sidebar, and then selecting an API and a version. *Each API version can be linked to only one CI project*.
1. Select the **Test** tab.
1. Under **Connect to CI/CD Builds**, select **CircleCI**.

1. For **API Key**, enter your CircleCI token.
1. Enter a **Nickname** to help you recognize the integration later.
1. Select the **CI project** used for your API.
1. Select **Connect**.

## Configuring Newman for CircleCI

With the help of Newman and the Postman API, you can run API tests created in Postman as part of your CI pipeline. First [generate the Newman configuration code](/docs/integrations/ci-integrations/#configuring-newman-for-ci) in Postman. Then add the configuration code to CircleCI:

1. Open your project in CircleCI, select a branch, and then select **Edit Config**.
1. Paste the Newman configuration you copied from Postman:
    * Replace both instances of `$POSTMAN_API_KEY` with a valid [Postman API Key](/docs/developer/intro-api/#generating-a-postman-api-key).
    * Make sure to add the `newman-collection-run` job to a new or existing workflow.
1. Select **Save and Run** to run the pipeline using the new configuration.
1. To view the test results in Postman, open your API and select the **Tests** tab.
