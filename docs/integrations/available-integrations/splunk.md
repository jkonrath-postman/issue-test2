Splunk is a monitoring service for cloud-scale applications. It combines data from servers, databases, tools, and services to present a unified view of an entire stack. This integration allows you to configure your Postman Monitors to send metrics to Splunk where you can visualize and compare them with other metrics.

Setting up a Splunk integration requires you to get an HTTP Event Collector (HEC) Token from Splunk and configure your Postman Monitors. After you set up the integration, you can view real-time alerts based on the results of your monitors.

## Retrieving your Splunk HEC token

Log in to [Splunk](https://login.splunk.com) and follow the [steps from Splunk](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/8.1.0/Metrics/GetMetricsInOther#Get_metrics_in_from_clients_over_HTTP_or_HTTPS
) to create and save your HTTP Event Collector token (HEC token). Save the HEC token to configure the Postman Splunk integration.
