You can use Keen IO for API-based computation, Amazon S3 backups, and building visualizations and dashboards for your APIs. Connect your Postman Monitor results to Keen Streams with the Postman to Keen Integration.

Setting up a Keen integration requires you to get a project ID and API key before configuring Postman Monitors to push to Keen streams. After you set up the integration, you can view all monitoring data in Keen IO.

## Retrieving your Keen IO project ID and API Key

1. Log in to [Keen IO](https://keen.io/users/login/).
1. Select **Projects**.

1. Select the **Access** tab in the dashboard.
1. Make a note of your project ID and API key to use later.

1. Select **Add Integration**. You can send the results of multiple monitors to the same Keen IO collection.

## Viewing data in Keen IO

Within a few minutes, you should start to see data flowing into Keen IO if your Monitor is running. If you’ve sent the results of multiple Postman Monitors to Keen, you’ll be able to segment by Monitor name/id, Collection name/id, error code, and so on.

Here’s a preview of analyses from the Postman Monitors integration. You can build visualizations into dashboards that your team or customers can view with [Keen dashboard templates](https://keen.io/docs/visualize/data-visualization-library/create-dashboard/).
